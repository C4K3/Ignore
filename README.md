Ignore
=====

A bukkit plugin that lets player's ignore each other.

Do note that this plugin due to technical reasons replaces both the /me and /tell commands. If another plugin also replaces the /me or /tell command, it will conflict with this plugin.

Commands
-----
```
/ignore [player]
```
(Un)ignores [player] (it's toggled).
If no player is specified, shows who you are currently ignoring.
